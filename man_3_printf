“NAME”
_printf


“SYNOPSIS”
_printf() function takes 2 arguments: a character pointer to a string: format
and a 'variable arguments list': arg_list. _printf() loops through the format 
string searching for a conversion specifier, which is indicated with the '%'
symbol. If found, the match_specifier() function loops through an array of 
structs (containing character and function pairs) to find the specifier 
function that is matched with the given conversion specifier from the format 
string, and then returns a pointer to that paired function. _printf() uses the 
pointer to that specifier function to call the specifier function on the next 
queued argument from the arg_list. Each specifier function writes a character
one at a time as determined from the value in arg_list.


"RETURN VALUE"
The function printf returns the number of characters printed. In case of  error it returns a negative value.


“COMPILATION”
Files compile  with Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS using  using gcc  with  options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89


“EXAMPLES”


“DESCRIPTION”
